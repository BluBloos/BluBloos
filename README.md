### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Noah,

I'm interested in A.I and low-level programming. I've dabbled in making compilers, operating systems, etc...
Iâ€™m currently working on a  ðŸ‘€ computer vision project and Iâ€™m trying to learn ðŸ”Œ embedded programming. I've been playing around with React.js as well - love it. 

Looking for a chat? â˜• You can reach me at <noah.cabral@queensu.ca>
